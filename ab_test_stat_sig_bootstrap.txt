AB Test Output Columns

source
  Meaning: Data source name from source_map
  How to Read: Example: GAM_MW → the dataset used for this test.

control_name
  Meaning: Name of the control variant
  How to Read: Example: mw-c → baseline group.

variant_name
  Meaning: Name of the variant
  How to Read: Example: mw-t → group being tested.

group columns
  Meaning: Columns used for optional multi-level grouping
  How to Read: Example: page_type=article, page_section=sports. Shows which subgroup this row corresponds to.

min_date / max_date
  Meaning: Earliest and latest dates in this group
  How to Read: Helps know the time range of the data included.

metric
  Meaning: Metric being tested
  How to Read: Example: ctr, cpc, revenue.

control
  Meaning: Metric value for the control group
  How to Read: Example: 0.05 CTR → 5% click-through rate.

variant
  Meaning: Metric value for the variant group
  How to Read: Example: 0.06 CTR → 6% click-through rate.

absolute_lift
  Meaning: variant − control
  How to Read: Example: 0.01 → variant improved CTR by 1 percentage point. Always based on actual data, not bootstrap.

relative_lift
  Meaning: (variant − control) / control
  How to Read: Example: 0.01 / 0.05 = 0.2 → 20% relative improvement. Uses actual values.

p_value
  Meaning: Statistical test p-value
  How to Read:
    - For proportions (ctr): z-test
    - For ratios (cpc/cpm): t-test or bootstrap p-value
    - <0.05 → statistically significant

significant
  Meaning: Boolean flag for p-value < α
  How to Read: True → difference is statistically significant, False → not significant

warning_flag
  Meaning: Potential data issue
  How to Read: True if metric missing, division by zero, or empty group; otherwise False

ci_lower / ci_upper (if using bootstrap)
  Meaning: 95% confidence interval for difference (variant − control)
  How to Read:
    - Positive range → variant likely better
    - Includes 0 → difference may not be meaningful
