## The Introductory Data Science Analysis Report

Data science is the field of exploring, manipulating, and analyzing data, and using data to answer questions or make recommendations.
 
Data scientists are usually curious people who take a stand on an argument and judge their findings and results. They analyze data using the appropriate tools, use storytelling skills to communicate their findings to relevant stakeholders, and propose solutions that aim to provide value to the business. They also use data to analyze the market, make comparisons to competition, and make recommendations of when and where an organization's product or services will be the most successful.

#### The ten components of a report at the end of a data science project include:
1. Cover Page - include the report's title, names of authors, their affiliations and contacts, name of the institutional publisher, and date of publication
2. Table of Contents - a map or list of topics in the report
3. Executive Summary (Abstract) - Explains the crux of the arguments 
4. Introductory Section - gently introduces the subject matter in an easily understandable format
5. Literature Review - available relevant research on the subject matter
6. Methodology - introduction to the research methods and data sources used for analysis 
7. Results - present the empirical findings
8. Discussion - craft the main arguments by building on the results you showed earlier, or where you rely on the power of narrative to table numbers to communicate your thesis to your readers
9. Conclusion - generalize the specific findings and maybe also identity future possible developments in research and applications that could result from your research
10. Housekeeping: References, Acknowledgments, and Appendices (if needed)
