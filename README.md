## The Introductory Data Science Analysis Report

Data science is the field of exploring, manipulating, and analyzing data, and using data to answer questions or make recommendations.
 
Data scientists are usually curious people who take a stand on an argument and judge their findings and results. They analyze data using the appropriate tools, use storytelling skills to communicate their findings to relevant stakeholders, and propose solutions that aim to provide value to the business. They also use data to analyze the market, make comparisons to competition, and make recommendations of when and where an organization's product or services will be the most successful.
